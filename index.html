        <h1>Conway's Game of Life</h1>
        <p>The Game of Life, also known as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970.</p>
        <h2>Basic Rules</h2>
        <p>The game is played on a two-dimensional grid of cells, each of which is either alive (populated) or dead (unpopulated). The game evolves in steps, with each cell's state in the next step determined by the states of its eight neighbors in the current step, following these rules:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if by underpopulation.</li>
            <li>Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.</li>
            <li>Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.</li>
            <li>Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Philosophical Implications</h2>
        <p>Conway's Game of Life raises intriguing philosophical questions about the nature of life, complexity, and self-organization. It demonstrates that simple rules can lead to complex and unpredictable patterns, challenging our understanding of how complexity arises in nature.</p>
